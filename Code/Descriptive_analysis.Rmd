## Overview of consolidations 2015-2021

In 2015 there were 7,642 Public Water Systems (PWSs) in the state, 3,015 of which were Community Water Systems (CWS) (2015 Safe Drinking Water Plan). Today, the state counts 7,351 PWS with 2,870 CWS. Some of this reduction can be attributed to system consolidations. Compiling various state data sources we have identified `r nrow(Uniqueprojects)` consolidation projects between 2015 and 2016.  

These consolidations have taken place in nearly every county (47 total) and involve the water providers of an estimated `r sum(na.omit(Receiving_systems$Receiving_2021_pop))` Californians. Of them, `r sum(na.omit(Data$Population))` have been incorporated as customers into a new water system as part of a consolidation project, in other words, were previously served by a *consolidated* system. 

Of the `r nrow(Uniqueprojects)` cases we identify, `r nrow(Managerial)` were managerial consolidations, another `r nrow(Physical)` were physical consolidations. Our data set consists of only `r nrow(Mandatory)` mandatory consolidations (Pratt MWC and Ceres West MHP) with the remainder being voluntary consolidations.  

```{r distance, include=FALSE, echo= FALSE}
Physicallyconsolidatedsystems <- Data %>% filter(Physical_or_Mangerial == "Physical") 
PhysicallyconsolidatedCWS <- Data %>% filter(Physical_or_Mangerial == "Physical") %>% filter(System_Type == "C")

Manageriallyconsolidatedsystems <- Data %>% filter(Physical_or_Mangerial == "Managerial") 

Data$Distance.miles <- round(Data$Distance.m./1609.344,3)
```

Among the `r nrow(Physicallyconsolidatedsystems)` water systems physical consolidated, the mean distance between these systems and the service boundary of the system to which they were connected was `r round(mean(na.omit(Physicallyconsolidatedsystems$Distance.m.))/1609.344, 3)` miles, the median distance was `r round(median(na.omit(Physicallyconsolidatedsystems$Distance.m.))/1609.344,3)`. The minimum distance was `r round(min(na.omit(Physicallyconsolidatedsystems$Distance.m.))/1609.344,3)` miles (ie already in the service boundaries) and the maximum was `r round(max(na.omit(Physicallyconsolidatedsystems$Distance.m.))/1609.344,3)` miles. 

Only considering the `r nrow(PhysicallyconsolidatedCWS)` physically consolidated CWS the mean distance between these systems and the service boundary of the system to which they were connected was `r round(mean(na.omit(PhysicallyconsolidatedCWS$Distance.m.))/1609.344,3)` miles, the median distance was `r round(median(na.omit(PhysicallyconsolidatedCWS$Distance.m.))/1609.344,3)`

## Drivers of consolidation

The SWRCB has publicly available information on factors driving or incentivizing consolidation in `r Data %>% tally(!is.na(Issue_summary))` of the consolidated water systems in our dataset. Grouping this descriptive information into categories, we find that water quality concerns are by far the most common reason for consolidation (`r Data %>% tally(Issue_summary=="Quality")` cases). Table 1 below provides frequencies for all five categories, none indicates that no driving factors or issues were listed. "Sustainability" in turn indicates that the reasons given were pro-active, e.g., reliance on a single source. Capacity indicates source capacity whereas TMF capacity indicates technical, managerial and financial capacity.

```{r drivers, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(summary(na.omit(Data$Issue_summary)), col.names = "#")

knitr::kable(summary(na.omit(Physicallyconsolidatedsystems$Issue_summary)), col.names = "#")

knitr::kable(summary(na.omit(Manageriallyconsolidatedsystems$Issue_summary)), col.names = "#")
```

## Characteristics of all consolidated systems

As previously mentioned, `r sum(na.omit(Data$Population))` Californians were served by a water system that was consolidated between January 2015 and December 2021. The mean population served by one of these systems is `r round(mean(Data$Population), digits=0)` with a minimum of `r min(Data$Population)` (as listed in SDWIS data) and maximum of `r max(Data$Population)`. The median population served,  however, is `r median(Data$Population)` indicating that the vast majority of consolidated systems are very small. 

The `r nrow(Uniqueprojects)` consolidation projects studied here resulted in the inactivation of approximately `r (nrow(Data)-3)` Public Water Systems between 2015 and 2016. `r Data %>% filter(System_Type == "C") %>% tally()` of these systems were Community Water Systems (CWS). The remainder are a mix of NC and NTNC systems. Further we identify `r Data %>% filter(System_Type == "SSWS") %>% tally()` consolidation of a state small water systems and `r sum(is.na(Data$System_Type))` instances of consolidating domestic well communities. 

`r Data %>% filter(Consolidatedsystem_primary_source_combinedFINAL == "GW" | Consolidatedsystem_primary_source_combinedFINAL == "GWP") %>% tally()` of these systems relied on groundwater as their primary source, another `r Data %>% filter(Consolidatedsystem_primary_source_combinedFINAL == "SW" | Consolidatedsystem_primary_source_combinedFINAL == "SWP") %>% tally()` relied on surface water.

These systems, in turn, represent `r sum(table(unique(Data$Institution_type)))` different institutional/governing types (See Dobbin & Fencl 2021). These types can be furthered grouped into `r sum(table(unique(Data$govcat_cons)))` The most common type is Private ancillary systems. The second most common type is public ancillary systems. See table below and see appendix for more detailed institutional type distribution.

```{r gov cat cons, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
govcat_cons <- as.data.frame(table(Data$govcat_cons))
govcat_cons <- rename(govcat_cons, "Governance Category" = "Var1")
govcat_cons <- govcat_cons[order(govcat_cons$Freq, decreasing = TRUE),] 
knitr::kable(govcat_cons, row.names = FALSE)
```

## Characteristics of consolidated Community Water Systems

Among just the consolidated systems that were CWSs, these statistics are as follows. 

```{r CWS consolidated systems, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(summarize(CWS,
           Count = n(),
           Population_mean = mean(Population),
           Population_median = median(Population),
           Population_min = min(Population),
           Population_max = max(Population)))
```

`r CWS %>% filter(Consolidatedsystem_primary_source_combinedFINAL == "GW" | Consolidatedsystem_primary_source_combinedFINAL == "GWP") %>% tally()` of the consolidated CWS relied on groundwater as their primary source, another `r CWS %>% filter(Consolidatedsystem_primary_source_combinedFINAL == "SW" | Consolidatedsystem_primary_source_combinedFINAL == "SWP") %>% tally()` relied on surface water.   

These systems, in turn, represent `r sum(table(unique(CWS$Institution_type)))` different institutional/governing types (See Dobbin & Fencl 2021) also spanning `r sum(table(unique(CWS$govcat_cons)))`. The most common governance type is Private Ancillary systems followed by IOUs and private nonprofit systems.

```{r gov types CWS only, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
ConsolidatedtypeCWS <- as.data.frame(table(CWS$Institution_type))
ConsolidatedtypeCWS <- rename(ConsolidatedtypeCWS, "Institutional_Type" = "Var1")
ConsolidatedtypeCWS <- ConsolidatedtypeCWS[order(ConsolidatedtypeCWS$Freq, decreasing = TRUE),] 
ConsolidatedtypeCWS$Freq[ConsolidatedtypeCWS$Freq==0] <- NA
ConsolidatedtypeCWS<-ConsolidatedtypeCWS[complete.cases(ConsolidatedtypeCWS),]

knitr::kable(ConsolidatedtypeCWS, row.names=FALSE)

govcat_cons_CWS <- as.data.frame(table(CWS$govcat_cons))
govcat_cons_CWS <- rename(govcat_cons_CWS, "Governance Category" = "Var1")
govcat_cons_CWS <- govcat_cons_CWS[order(govcat_cons_CWS$Freq, decreasing = TRUE),] 
knitr::kable(govcat_cons_CWS, row.names = FALSE)

```

## Characteristics of receiving water systems
Among the `r nrow(Receiving_systems)` unique receiving water systems, 87 rely on groundwater as their primary source, another 55 rely on surface water. 133 of these systems are community water systems. 

```{r receiving system characteristics, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
Projectbyreceiving <- as.data.frame(table(Uniqueprojects$Receiving_System_ID))
```

`r Projectbyreceiving %>% filter(Freq >1) %>% tally()` of these systems participated in more than one consolidation project over the study period. `r Projectbyreceiving %>% filter(Freq == 6) %>% tally()` systems participated in 6 consolidation projects each over the course of the 6 years. Another system, South Tahoe PUD, participated in `r max(Projectbyreceiving$Freq)`.

## Characteristics of only systems "receiving" CWSs in consolidations

Among the systems that were receiving systems in the above cases of CWS consolidation, we find similar diversity in institutional types, IOUs are the most common receiving system type and City's the second most common. Overall, `r sum(table(unique(CWS$Receiving_System_Institution_Type)))` different institutional types acted as receiving systems over the studied period spanning `r sum(table(unique(CWS$govcat_rec)))`. See appendix for the break down of institutional types and governance categories for all receiving systems not just those receiving CWS. 

```{r recieving systems gov, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
Receiving_systems_CWS <- CWS %>% distinct(Receiving_System_ID)
governancecategory_rec <- read_csv("Data/govcategory_receiving.csv")
Receiving_systems_CWS <- left_join(Receiving_systems_CWS, governancecategory_rec)
Receiving_systems_CWS$Category <- as.factor(Receiving_systems_CWS$Category)

govcat_rec <- as.data.frame(table(Receiving_systems_CWS$Category))
govcat_rec <- rename(govcat_rec, "Governance Category" = "Var1")
govcat_rec <- govcat_rec[order(govcat_rec$Freq, decreasing = TRUE),] 
knitr::kable(govcat_rec, row.names = FALSE)

Receiving_inst_types <- Receiving_systems %>% select(Receiving_System_ID, Receiving_System_Institution_Type)
Receiving_systems_CWS <- left_join(Receiving_systems_CWS, Receiving_inst_types)

intype_rec <- as.data.frame(table(Receiving_systems_CWS$Receiving_System_Institution_Type))
intype_rec <- rename(intype_rec, "Institutional Type" = "Var1")
intype_rec <-intype_rec[-c(5,8,11,12,14,18),]
intype_rec <- intype_rec[order(intype_rec$Freq, decreasing = TRUE),]
knitr::kable(intype_rec, row.names = FALSE)
```

## Governance change as a result of CWS consolidations

```{r gov combos, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
cat_Pathways <- CWS
cat_Pathways$Pathway <- paste(cat_Pathways$govcat_cons, ", ", cat_Pathways$govcat_rec)
cat_Pathways$Pathway <- as.factor(cat_Pathways$Pathway)
cat_Pathwaystable <- as.data.frame(table(cat_Pathways$Pathway))
cat_Pathwaystable <- cat_Pathwaystable[order(cat_Pathwaystable$Freq, decreasing = TRUE),]
```

Using this information about consolidated and receiving system types, then, we are able to identify how CWS governance is changing in the state as a result of consolidations. In total, CWS consolidations represent `r sum(table(unique(cat_Pathwaystable$Var1)))` distinct governance changes, the five most common of which are displayed in the table below. 

```{r most common combos, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
cat_Pathwaystable_head <- top_n(cat_Pathwaystable, 5)
knitr::kable(cat_Pathwaystable_head, row.names=FALSE, col.names = c("Change from, to", "#"))
```
